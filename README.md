Deployed version: https://al-88-nc-news.netlify.app/

This is the frontend application for my first React project, built during my Northcoders bootcamp. The site is a news-style platform where you can browse articles, read comments, and interact with content as a logged-in user (grumpy19).

You can:

Browse all articles, or filter them by topic

Sort articles by various fields (e.g. date, comment count, votes) and choose ascending or descending order

View individual articles and their associated comments

Vote on articles

Add new comments

Delete your own comments (only comments made by the logged-in user can be deleted)

For the backend portion of this project, visit:
